# spotifyOBS

Custom script to play, pause, to go the next or previous tracks. I built this script to specifically allow me to pause/play music when switching between specific scenes in OBS.

### Installing

Move to your preferred directory then run the following command:

	git clone https://github.com/JonathanShrek/spotifyOBS

### Future Scope

* Add a search feature
* Show/log played songs
